		  differences in the species richness and composition of

  abstract	= {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting
		  changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts
		  on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional
		  regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but
		  prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously
		  difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in
		  ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and
		  autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning
		  indicators of impending shifts. A critical question,
		  however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient
		  warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We
		  examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime
		  shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or
		  shoreline development (only gradual restoration is
		  possible). The model represents key features of a broad
		  class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers
		  can only be manipulated gradually management action is
		  needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if
		  drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be
		  delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the
		  indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated,
		  often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve
		  usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that
		  research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather
		  than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical
		  indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem
		  attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio
		  indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is
		  also dependent on developing policy processes that enable
		  society to respond more rapidly to information about
		  impending regime shifts.},

  abstract	= {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and
		  long-lasting environmental damage with large economic
		  costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental
		  regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management.
		  As an illustrative example, we applied six potential
		  indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter
		  and W. A. Brock's model of lake eutrophication and analyzed
		  whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to
		  enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses
		  suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency
		  signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides
		  the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only
		  incomplete information about underlying system drivers and
		  processes is available. In light of this result, we
		  explored two key factors associated with using indicators
		  to prevent regime shifts. The first key factor is the
		  amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system
		  will react to a change in management, given that a manager
		  can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid,
		  intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that
		  an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning
		  to reduce the probability of a regime shift to < 5\%. As
		  time to intervention is increased or intensity of
		  intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance
		  warning required to avoid a regime shift increases
		  exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount
		  and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the
		  impact of this variability on the power of an indicator.
		  Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an
		  impending regime shift with adequate lead time for
		  effective management intervention, but not so far in
		  advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary.
		  Intrinsic "noise" in the system obscures the "signal"
		  provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the
		  indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and
		  between-year variability in measurable variables or
		  parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human
		  decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of
		  pro-active application of the precautionary principle to
		  avoid regime shifts.},

  abstract	= {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable
		  climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to
		  a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of
		  abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
		  reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains
		  hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even
		  more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
		  tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future.
		  Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and
		  show that they were all preceded by a characteristic
		  slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the
		  actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
		  autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
		  hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
		  independent empirical evidence for the idea that past
		  abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical
		  thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
		  fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that
		  our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal
		  early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change.
		  Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex
		  systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this
		  is a promising perspective.},

  abstract	= {Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services,
		  which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions
		  from one stable state to another. Discontinuous transitions
		  are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic
		  changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial
		  ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation
		  patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent
		  transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness
		  changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing
		  pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach.
		  In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to
		  even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation
		  patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid
		  Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we
		  found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation
		  follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton
		  model, we show that local positive interactions among
		  plants can explain such power-law distributions.
		  Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field
		  data revealed consistent deviations from power laws.
		  Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in
		  the model. When grazing was further increased in the model,
		  we found that these deviations always and only occurred
		  close to transition to desert, independent of the type of
		  transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover.
		  Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be
		  a warning signal for the onset of desertification.},

		  eScience has been invaluable in this work and we explain
		  how we have made it work for us. Two stable states of the
		  THC have been found to coexist, under the same boundary
		  conditions, in a hierarchy of models. The climate forcing
		  required to collapse the THC and the reversibility or

		  parameters. Anthropogenic climate forcing leads to a robust
		  weakening of the THC and increases the probability of
		  crossing a THC tipping point, but some ensemble members
		  collapse readily, whereas others are extremely resistant.
		  Hence, we test general methods that have been developed to
		  directly diagnose, from time-series data, the proximity of
		  a 'tipping element', such as the THC to a bifurcation

		  regime shifts sometimes have severe consequences for human

		  evaluate conditional heteroscedasticity by using ecological

		  On approaching transition points, all time series contain
		  significant conditional heteroscedasticity. This signal is
		  detected hundreds of time steps in advance of the regime

		  Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift

		  a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in

		  slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold
		  point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as
		  an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical
		  slowing down could also indicate other critical
