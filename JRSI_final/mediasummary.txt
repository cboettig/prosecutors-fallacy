The paper by Boettiger and Hastings carefully considers the problem of predicting sudden changes in systems before they occur, the problem of early warning signs for tipping points. This paper is one of the first careful statistical analyses of the problem and emphasizes approaches that allow calculation both of the probability of detecting a sudden change before it occurs as well as the probability of not being able to detect a sudden change. The approach and methods will have wide applicability in systems ranging from ecological systems to much larger scale systems.
