		  reorganizations of complex systems, such as ecosystems.
		  Large ecosystem changes such as eutrophication, shifts
		  among vegetation types, degradation of coral reefs and
		  regional climate change often come as surprises because we
		  lack leading indicators for regime shifts. Increases in
		  variability of ecosystems have been suggested to foreshadow
		  ecological regime shifts. However, it may be difficult to
		  discern variability due to impending regime shift from that
		  of exogenous drivers that affect the ecosystem. We
		  addressed this problem using a model of lake
		  eutrophication. Lakes are subject to fluctuations in
		  recycling associated with regime shifts, as well as
		  fluctuating nutrient inputs. Despite the complications of
		  noisy inputs, increasing variability of lake-water
		  phosphorus was discernible prior to the shift to eutrophic
		  conditions. Simulations show that rising standard deviation
		  (SD) could signal impending shifts about a decade in
		  advance. The rising SD was detected by studying variability
		  around predictions of a simple time-series model, and did
		  not depend on detailed knowledge of the actual ecosystem

  abstract	= {In the Earth's history, periods of relatively stable
		  climate have often been interrupted by sharp transitions to
		  a contrasting state. One explanation for such events of
		  abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system
		  reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains
		  hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even
		  more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a
		  tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future.
		  Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and
		  show that they were all preceded by a characteristic
		  slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the
		  actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased
		  autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a
		  hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply
		  independent empirical evidence for the idea that past
		  abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical
		  thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is
		  fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that
		  our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal
		  early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change.
		  Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex
		  systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this
		  is a promising perspective.},

		  descriptions that will not have smooth potentials,
		  concluding that many ecological systems are described by
		  systems without smooth potentials and thus will not show
		  typical leading indicators of regime shifts. We then
		  illustrate the impact of these general arguments by
		  numerically examining the dynamics of several model
		  ecological systems under slowly changing conditions. Our

  abstract	= {Humans and climate affect ecosystems and their services,
		  which may involve continuous and discontinuous transitions
		  from one stable state to another. Discontinuous transitions
		  are abrupt, irreversible and among the most catastrophic
		  changes of ecosystems identified. For terrestrial
		  ecosystems, it has been hypothesized that vegetation
		  patchiness could be used as a signature of imminent
		  transitions. Here, we analyse how vegetation patchiness
		  changes in arid ecosystems with different grazing
		  pressures, using both field data and a modelling approach.
		  In the modelling approach, we extrapolated our analysis to
		  even higher grazing pressures to investigate the vegetation
		  patchiness when desertification is imminent. In three arid
		  Mediterranean ecosystems in Spain, Greece and Morocco, we
		  found that the patch-size distribution of the vegetation
		  follows a power law. Using a stochastic cellular automaton
		  model, we show that local positive interactions among
		  plants can explain such power-law distributions.
		  Furthermore, with increasing grazing pressure, the field
		  data revealed consistent deviations from power laws.
		  Increased grazing pressure leads to similar deviations in
		  the model. When grazing was further increased in the model,
		  we found that these deviations always and only occurred
		  close to transition to desert, independent of the type of
		  transition, and regardless of the vegetation cover.
		  Therefore, we propose that patch-size distributions may be
		  a warning signal for the onset of desertification.},

		  threatens global biodiversity, ecosystem function, and the
		  livelihoods of millions of people living in tropical
		  coastal regions. Reefs in the Caribbean are among the most
		  heavily affected, having experienced mass disease-induced
		  mortality of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum in
		  1983 and two framework-building species of coral. Declining
		  reef health is characterized by increases in macroalgae. A
		  critical question is whether the observed macroalgal bloom
		  on Caribbean reefs is easily reversible. To answer this
		  question, we must resolve whether algal-dominated reefs are
		  an alternative stable state of the ecosystem or simply the
		  readily reversible result of a phase change along a
		  gradient of some environmental or ecological parameter.
		  Here, using a fully parameterized simulation model in
		  combination with a simple analytical model, we show that
		  Caribbean reefs became susceptible to alternative stable
		  states once the urchin mortality event of 1983 confined the
		  majority of grazing to parrotfishes. We reveal dramatic
		  hysteresis in a natural system and define critical
		  thresholds of grazing and coral cover beyond which
		  resilience is lost. Most grazing thresholds lie near the
		  upper level observed for parrotfishes in nature, suggesting
		  that reefs are highly sensitive to parrotfish exploitation.
		  Ecosystem thresholds can be combined with stochastic models
		  of disturbance to identify targets for the restoration of
		  ecosystem processes. We illustrate this principle by
		  estimating the relationship between current reef state
		  (coral cover and grazing) and the probability that the reef
		  will withstand moderate hurricane intensity for two decades
		  without becoming entrained in a shift towards a stable
		  macroalgal-dominated state. Such targets may help reef
		  managers face the challenge of addressing global
		  disturbance at local scales.},

@Article{	  VanNes2007,
  abstract	= {The size of the basin of attraction in ecosystems with
		  alternative stable states is often referred to as
		  "ecological resilience." Ecosystems with a low ecological
		  resilience may easily be tipped into an alternative basin
		  of attraction by a stochastic event. Unfortunately, it is
		  very difficult to measure ecological resilience in
		  practice. Here we show that the rate of recovery from small
		  perturbations (sometimes called "engineering resilience")
		  is a remarkably good indicator of ecological resilience.
		  Such recovery rates decrease as a catastrophic regime shift
		  is approached, a phenomenon known in physics as "critical
		  slowing down." We demonstrate the robust occurrence of
		  critical slowing down in six ecological models and outline
		  a possible experimental approach to quantify differences in
		  recovery rates. In all the models we analyzed, critical
		  slowing down becomes apparent quite far from a threshold
		  point, suggesting that it may indeed be of practical use as
		  an early warning signal. Despite the fact that critical
		  slowing down could also indicate other critical
		  transitions, such as a stable system becoming oscillatory,
		  the robustness of the phenomenon makes it a promising
		  indicator of loss of resilience and the risk of upcoming
		  regime shifts in a system.},
