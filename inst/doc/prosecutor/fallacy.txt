Abstract 


6 


Early 
warning 
signals 
have 
been 
proposed 
to 
forecast 
the 
possibility 
of 
a 
critical 
transition, 


7 


such 
as 
the 
eutrophication 
of 
a 
lake, 
the 
collapse 
of 
a 
coral 
reef, 
or 
the 
end 
of 
a 
glacial 
period. 


8 


Because 
such 
transitions 
often 
unfold 
on 
temporal 
and 
spatial 
scales 
that 
can 
be 
dicult 
to 


9 


approach 
by 
experimental 
manipulation, 
research 
has 
often 
relied 
on 
historical 
observations 
as 
a 


10 


source 
of 
natural 
experiments. 
Here 
we 
examine 
a 
critical 
dierence 
between 
selecting 
systems 


11 


for 
study 
based 
on 
the 
fact 
that 
we 
have 
observed 
a 
critical 
transition 
and 
those 
systems 
for 


12 


which 
we 
wish 
to 
forecast 
the 
approach 
of 
a 
transition. 
This 
dierence 
arises 
by 
conditionally 


13 


selecting 
systems 
known 
to 
experience 
a 
transition 
of 
some 
sort 
and 
failing 
to 
account 
for 
the 


14 


bias 
this 
introduces 
– 
a 
statistical 
error 
often 
known 
as 
the 
Prosecutor's 
Fallacy. 
By 
analyzing 


15 


simulated 
systems 
that 
have 
experienced 
transitions 
purely 
by 
chance, 
we 
reveal 
an 
elevated 
rate 


16 


of 
false 
postives 
in 
common 
warning 
signal 
statistics. 
We 
further 
demonstrate 
a 
model-based 


17 


approach 
that 
is 
less 
subject 
to 
this 
bias 
than 
these 
more 
commonly 
used 
summary 
statistics. 


18 


We 
note 
that 
experimental 
studies 
with 
replicates 
avoid 
this 
pitfall 
entirely.

In 
the 
case 
of 
People 
v. 
Collins 
1968, 
California 
Supreme 
Court 
considered 
the 
evidence 
of 


24 


an 
expert 
witness 
described 
by 
the 
court 
as 
\an 
instructor 
of

which 
concluded 
that 
the 
probability 
that 
a 
randomly 
selected 
individual 
would 
match 
the 
26 


description 
given 
by 
the 
victim 
would 
be 
less 
than 
1 
in 
12 
million 
(Peo, 
1968).

had 
produced 
an 
individual 
matching 
the 
prosecutor's 
detailed 
description, 
and 
convinced 
by 


28 


the 
mathematics, 
the 
lower 
courts 
had 
found 
him 
guilty. 


29 


The 
prosecution 
has 
only 
observed 
that 
the 
probability 
of 
seeing 
the 
evidence 
(E) 
they 


30 


produced 
given 
a 
random 
innocent 
individual 
(I), 
P 
(EjI) 
is 
very 
small. 
From 
this 
one 
cannot 


31 


conclude 
that 
the 
individual 
is 
indeed 
guilty, 
that 
is, 
that 
the 
probability 
the 
individual 
is 


32 


innocent 
given 
the 
evidence 
P 
(IjE) 
is 
also 
very 
small. 
In 
a 
city 
with 
millions 
of 
people, 
there 


33 


might 
be 
several 
individuals 
who 
match 
the 
description 
of 
the 
evidence.

The 
California 
34 
Supreme 
Court 
reversed 
the 
decision, 
and 
the 
case 
became 
a 
widely 
recognized 
example 
of 
35 


the 
Prosecutor's 
Fallacy 
(Thompson 
and 
Schumann, 
1987). 
Here 
we 
explore 
how 
a 
similar 


36 


misconception 
can 
arise 
from 
the 
use 
of 
historical 
data 
to 
evaluate 
methods 
for 
detecting 
early 


37 


warning 
signals 
of 
critical 
transitions. 


38 


Catastrophic 
transitions 
or 
tipping 
points, 
where 
a 
complex 
system 
shifts 
suddenly 
from 
one 


39 


state 
to 
another, 
have 
been 
implicated 
in 
a 
wide 
array 
of 
ecological 
and 
global 
climate 
systems 


40 


such 
as 
lake 
ecosystems 
(Carpenter, 
2011), 
coral 
reefs 
(Mumby 
et 
al., 
2007), 
savannah 
(Kefi 


41 


et 
al., 
2007), 
sheries 
(Berkes 
et 
al., 
2006), 
and 
tropical 
forests 
(Hirota 
et 
al., 
2011). 
Re


42 


cent 
research 
has 
begun 
to 
identify 
statistical 
patterns 
commonly 
associated 
with 
these 
sudden 


43 


catastrophic 
transitions 
which 
could 
be 
used 
as 
an 
early 
warning 
sign 
to 
identify 
an 
approaching 


44 


tipping 
point, 
which 
might 
provide 
managers 
time 
to 
react 
to 
and 
avert 
an 
undesirable 
state 


45 


shift 
(Scheer 
et 
al., 
2009; 
Lenton, 
2011). 
An 
array 
of 
statistical 
patterns 
associated 
with 
tip


46 


ping 
point 
phenomena 
has 
been 
suggested 
for 
the 
detection 
of 
early 
warning 
signals 
associated 
47 
with 
such 
sudden 
transitions. 
Two 
of 
the 
most 
commonly 
used 
are 
a 
pattern 
of 
increasing 
48 


variance 
(Carpenter 
and 
Brock, 
2006) 
and 
a 
pattern 
of 
increasing 
autocorrelation 
(van 
Nes 
and 


49 


Scheer, 
2007), 
which 
have 
been 
tested 
in 
both 
experimental 
manipulation 
(Drake 
and 
Grien, 


50 


2010; 
Carpenter, 
2011; 
Veraart 
et 
al., 
2011) 
and 
historical 
observations 
(Livina 
and 
Lenton, 
2007;

et 
al., 
2008;

Testing 
patterns 
on 
historical 
data 


54 


Historical 
examples 
of 
sudden 
transitions 
taken 
from 
the 
paleoclimate 
record 
provide 
an 
im


55 


portant 
way 
to 
test 
and 
evaluate 
potential 
leading 
indicator 
methods, 
and 
have 
been 
widely 
used 


56 


for 
this 
purpose 
(Livina 
and 
Lenton, 
2007; 
Dakos 
et 
al., 
2008; 
Lenton 
et 
al., 
2012; 
Ditlevsen 
and 


57 


Johnsen, 
2010; 
Guttal 
and 
Jayaprakash, 
2008; 
Thompson 
and 
Sieber, 
2010). 
Similarly, 
it 
has 


58 


been 
suggested 
that 
data 
gathered 
from 
ecological 
systems 
such 
as 
lakes 
that 
were 
monitored 


59 


before 
they 
experienced 
sudden 
eutriphication, 
or 
grasslands 
subjected 
to 
overgrazing, 
could 


60 


contain 
data 
that 
could 
help 
reveal 
when 
similar 
systems 
are 
approaching 
a 
tipping 
point 
(Car


61 


penter, 
2011). 


62 


However, 
testing 
methods 
for 
early 
warning 
signals 
against 
historical 
examples 
of 
transitions 
63 
is 
suspetible 
to 
statistical 
mistakes 
that 
arise 
from 
selecting 
data 
conditional 
on 
that 
data 
64 


having 
already 
exhibited 
a 
sudden 
transition. 
A 
central 
tenent 
of 
early 
warning 
theory 
is 
that 


65 


the 
system 
in 
question 
is 
slowly 
approaching 
a 
tipping 
point 
that 
lies 
some 
unknown 
distance 


66 


away. 
If 
nothing 
is 
done 
to 
remedy 
the 
situation, 
this 
slow 
change 
will 
inevitably 
carry 
the 


67 


system 
beyond 
the 
tipping 
point, 
which 
introduces 
a 
sudden, 
rapid 
transition 
into 
an 
undesirable 


68 


state 
(Scheer 
et 
al., 
2009). 
This 
process 
can 
be 
described 
mathematically 
as 
a 
bifurcation, 
in 


69 


which 
a 
slowly 
changing 
parameter 
reaches 
a 
critical 
value 
that 
causes 
the 
system 
stability 
to 


70 


change. 


71 


Not 
all 
sudden 
transitions 
are 
caused 
by 
some 
\guilty” 
process 
slowly 
driving 
the 
system 
over 


72 


a 
tipping 
point 
– 
the 
kind 
of 
process 
that 
early 
warning 
signals 
are 
designed 
to 
detect. 
Some 


73 


systems 
may 
experience 
such 
transitions 
purely 
by 
chance, 
leaving 
a 
stable 
state 
on 
an 
extremely 


74 


unlikely 
excursion 
that 
happens 
to 
stray 
to 
far 
from 
the 
stable 
attractor 
(e.g. 
Ditlevsen 
and 


75 


Johnsen, 
2010; 
Lenton, 
2011, 
consider 
this 
possibility 
in 
transitions 
that 
arise 
from 
analyzing 


76 


historical 
climate 
record). 
Like 
the 
evidence 
presented 
before 
the 
California 
Supreme 
Court 
in 


77 


1968, 
the 
chance 
of 
observing 
such 
an 
\innocent” 
transition 
a 
priori 
may 
be 
very 
small, 
but 
when 


78 


selected 
from 
a 
historical 
record 
of 
many 
possible 
transitions, 
this 
possibility 
can 
no 
longer 
be 


79 


ignored. 


80 


Figure 
1 
shows 
a 
schematic 
illustrating 
critical 
transitions 
under 
each 
of 
these 
scenarios. 
In 
3 



81 


the 
left 
panel, 
the 
system 
experiences 
a 
bifurcation 
and 
should 
contain 
an 
early 
warning 
signal. 


82 


In 
the 
right 
panel, 
a 
similar-looking 
trajectory 
emerges 
from 
a 
simulation 
of 
a 
stable 
system 


83 


which 
should 
not 
contain 
a 
warning 
signal. 
While 
the 
simulation 
of 
the 
bifurcation 
scenario 


84 


shown 
on 
the 
left 
produces 
a 
similar 
transition 
every 
time, 
the 
transition 
shown 
on 
the 
right 
is 


85 


somewhat 
less 
likely, 
occurring 
in 
only 
1% 
of 
simulations. 


86 


2. 
Methods 
and 
Results 


87 


To 
investigate 
if 
early 
warning 
signals 
are 
vulnerable 
to 
this 
fallacy, 
we 
simulating 
a 
system 


88 


that 
is 
not 
driven 
towards 
a 
bifurcation 
(such 
as 
in 
the 
right-hand 
panel). 
This 
simulation 
89 
approach 
allows 
us 
to 
determine 
whether 
examining 
historical 
events 
is 
a 
good 
way 
to 
test 
90 


the 
utility 
of 
these 
indicators. 
We 
simulated 
20,000 
replicates 
of 
a 
stochastic 
individual-based 


91 


birth-death 
process 
with 
an 
Allee 
threshold 
(Courchamp 
et 
al., 
2008), 
which 
arises 
from 
positive 


92 


tness 
eects 
at 
low 
densities. 
Above 
the 
Allee 
threshold 
the 
population 
returns 
to 
a 
positive 


93 


equilibrium 
size, 
whereas 
below 
the 
threshold 
the 
population 
decreases 
to 
zero. 
The 
simulation 


94 


uses 
the 
Gillespie 
algorithm 
to 
provide 
an 
exact 
implementation 
of 
the 
master 
equation 
of 
the 


95 


birth-death 
process, 


dP

drives 
the 
Allee 
eect 


97 


at 
low 
densities 
and 
limits 
growth 
at 
high 
densities. 
The 
key 
feature 
of 
this 
model 
is 
the 
alternate 


98 


stable 
states 
introduced 
by 
this 
eect; 
other 
functional 
forms 
for 
Eq. 
(2) 
could 
serve 
equally 
well 


99 


for 
these 
simulations 
(see 
e.g. 
Scheer 
et 
al., 
2001). 
Though 
this 
system 
can 
be 
forced 
through 


100 


a 
bifurcation 
by 
increasing 
the 
death 
rate, 
in 
these 
simulations 
all 
parameters 
are 
held 
constant 


101 


and 
no 
bifurcation 
occurs. 
Consequently 
we 
do 
not 
anticipate 
an 
early 
warning 
signal 
of 
an 


102 


approaching 
bifurcation. 
The 
simulation 
starts 
from 
the 
positive 
equilibrium 
population 
size. 


103 


Though 
the 
chance 
of 
a 
transition 
across 
the 
Allee 
threshold 
in 
any 
given 
time 
step 
is 
small,

two 
cases. 
Potential 
is 
the 
negative 
integral 
of 
the 
mean 
of 
dynamical 
equation. 
The 
potential 
function 
gives 
an 
intuitive 
picture 
of 
the 
stability 
of 
a 
system 
by 
imagining 
the 
curve 
as 
a 
surface 
on 
which 
a 
ball 
is 
free 
to 
bounce 
across 
– 
wells 
correspond 
to 
stable 
points 
and 
peaks 
to 
unstable 
points. 
Early 
warning 
signals 
are 
aimed 
at 
detecting 
systems 
which 
are 
slowly 
moving 
towards 
a 
tipping 
point 
or 
bifurcation, 
illustrated 
in 
the 
successively 
darker 
potential 
curves 
in 
panel 
(a). 
An 
example 
trajectory 
from 
a 
simulation 
under 
this 
process 
shows 
the 
state 
of 
the 
system 
as 
the 
potential 
moves 
towards 
the 
bifurcation 
point. 
The 
state 
of 
the 
system 
in 
the 
simulation 
is 
given 
by 
the 
horizontal 
axis, 
while 
the 
vertical 
dimension 
is 
used 
to 
show 
time 
on 
the 
right-hand 
axis. 
Some 
stable 
systems,

may 
experience 
chance 
transitions 
to 
an 
alternate 
stable 
state 
without 
the 
presence 
of 
this 
slow 
change 
driving 
the 
system 
over 
the 
edge. 
An 
example 
of 
the 
trajectory 
of 
such 
a 
chance 
transition 
is 
plotted 
over 
the 
potential. 
While 
such 
events 
may 
be 
unlikely 
over 
short 
timescales, 
selecting 
historical 
examples 
of 
systems 
that 
have 
experienced 
sudden 
transitions 
increases 
the 
probability 
of 
accidentally 
using

We 
ran 
each 
replicate 
over 
50,000 
time 
unitss, 
sampling 
the 
system 
every 
50 
time 
units. 


106 


In 
this 
time

266 
of

experience 
population 
collapse. 
To 
keep 
the 


107 


examples 
of 
comparable 
sample 
size, 
we 
focus 
on 
a 
section 
of 
the 
data 
500 
time 
points 
prior 
to 


108 


the 
system 
approaching 
the 
transition. 


109 


To 
test 
whether 
selecting 
systems 
that 
have 
experienced 
spontaneous 
transitions 
could 
bias 


110 


the 
analysis 
towards 
false 
positive 
detection 
of 
early 
warning 
signals, 
(the 
Prosecutor's 
Fallacy) 


111 


we 
selected 
replicates 
conditional 
on 
having 
collapsed 
in 
the 
simulations. 
We 
then 
selected 
a 


112 


window 
around 
each 
system 
that 
ended 
just 
before 
the 
collapse, 
while 
the 
population 
values 


113 


were 
still 
above 
the 
Allee 
threshold. 
For 
each 
replicate, 
we 
calculated 
the 
most 
common 
early 


114 


warning 
indicators, 
variance 
and 
autocorrelation 
(e.g. 
Carpenter 
and 
Brock, 
2006; 
Dakos 
et 
al., 


115 


2008; 
Scheer 
et 
al., 
2009), 
around 
a 
moving 
window 
equal 
to 
half 
the 
length 
of 
that 
time 
series. 
116 
To 
test 
for 
the 
presence 
of 
a 
warning 
signal 
in 
these 
indicators 
we 
computed 
values 
of 
117 


Kendall's 
τ 
for 
both 
indicators 
for 
each 
of 
the 
266 
replicates. 
Kendall's 
τ 
takes 
values 
in 
(􀀀1, 
1), 


118 


and 
is 
frequently 
used 
to 
identify 
an 
increasing 
trend 
(> 
0) 
in 
early 
warning 
signals 
(Dakos 


119 


et 
al., 
2008, 
2011). 
The 
distribution 
of 
τ 
values 
observed 
across 
these 
replicates 
is 
shown 
in 


120 


Figure 
2. 
We 
compare 
the 
distribution 
of 
τ 
from 
all 
the 
simulations 
to 
the 
distribution 
condi


121 


tioned 
on 
experiencing 
a 
chance 
transition 
to 
the 
alternative 
stable 
state. 
To 
avoid 
an 
eect 
of 


122 


sample 
size 
the 
time 
series 
are 
all 
chosen 
to 
be 
the 
same 
length.

125 


For 
each 
of 
these 
replicates 
we 
also 
take 
a 
model-based 
approach, 
estimating 
parameters 


126 


for 
an 
approximate 
linear 
model 
of 
the 
system 
approaching 
a 
saddle 
node 
bifurcation, 
as 
de


127 


scribed 
Boettiger 
and 
Hastings 
(2012). 
In 
this 
model, 
the 
parameter 
m 
describes 
the 
approach 


128 


towards 
the 
saddle-node 
bifurcation. 
Estimates 
m< 
0 
are 
expected 
in 
systems 
approaching 
a 


129 


bifurcation, 
while 
for 
stable 
systems 
m 
should 
be 
approximately 
zero. 
None 
of 
the 
estimates 


130 


across 
the 
266 
simulations 
diered 
from 
zero 
in 
our 
study, 
hence 
the 
model-based 
estimation 


131 


shows 
no 
evidence 
of 
bias 
on 
data 
that 
has 
been 
selected 
conditional 
on 
collapse.

3. 
Discussion 


133 
We 
have 
shown 
that 
systems 
which 
undergo 
rare 
sudden 
transitions 
look 
statistically 
dierent 


134 
from 
their 
counterparts 
that 
do 
not, 
even 
though 
they 
are 
driven 
by 
the 
same 
stochastic 
process. 


135 
In 
particular, 
such 
conditionally 
selected 
examples 
are 
more 
likely 
to 
show 
signs 
associated 
with 


136 
an 
early 
warning 
of 
an 
approaching 
tipping 
point, 
such 
as 
increasing 
variance 
or 
increasing 


137 
autocorrelation, 
as 
measured 
by 
Kendall's 
. 
This 
increases 
the 
risk 
of 
false 
positives 
– 
cases 
in 


138 
which 
a 
warning 
signal 
being 
tested 
appears 
to 
have 
successfully 
detected 
an 
oncoming 
tipping 


139 
point, 
when 
in 
fact 
the 
example 
comes 
instead 
from 
a 
stable 
system. 
Figure 
2 
shows 
the 
extent 


140 
of 
this 
bias, 
where 
many 
of 
the 
chance 
crashes 
show 
values 
of 
τ 
that 
are 
signicantly 
larger 
than 


141 
those 
observed 
in 
the 
otherwise 
identical 
replicates 
that 
did 
not 
experience 
a 
chance 
transition. 


142 


3.1. 
Chance 
transitions 
are 
false 
positives 
for 
early 
warning 
signals 


143 
It 
seems 
tempting 
to 
argue 
that 
the 
bias 
towards 
positive 
detection 
in 
historical 
examples 


144 
is 
not 
problematic 
– 
each 
of 
these 
systems 
did 
indeed 
collapse, 
so 
the 
increased 
probability 
of 


145 
exhibiting 
warning 
signals 
could 
be 
taken 
as 
a 
successful 
detection. 
Unfortunately 
this 
is 
not 


146 
the 
case. 
At 
the 
moment 
the 
forecast 
is 
made, 
these 
systems 
are 
no 
more 
likely 
to 
crash 
than 


147 
their 
counterparts 
from 
the 
sample 
that 
did 
not 
collapse, 
just 
as 
a 
fair 
coin 
is 
still 
a 
fair 
coin 


148 
after 
a 
string 
of 
consecutive 
\heads.” 
A 
closer 
look 
at 
the 
patterns 
involved 
shows 
why 
common 


149 
indicators 
such 
as 
autocorrelation 
and 
variance 
can 
be 
misleading. 


150 


As 
the 
system 
gets 
farther 
from 
its 
stable 
point, 
it 
it 
more 
likely 
to 
draw 
a 
random 
step 
that 


151 


returns 
it 
towards 
the 
stable 
point. 
Despite 
this, 
there 
is 
always 
some 
probability 
that 
it 
will 


152 


move 
further 
still, 
so 
systems 
that 
do 
cross 
the 
tipping 
point 
must 
do 
so 
rather 
quickly 
by 
a 


153 


string 
of 
events. 
This 
pattern, 
clearly 
visible 
before 
the 
crashes 
in 
each 
of 
the 
examples 
in 
Figure 


154 


1, 
produces 
a 
string 
of 
observations 
that 
appear 
more 
highly 
autocorrelated 
(if 
we 
are 
sampling 


155 


the 
system 
frequently 
enough 
to 
catch 
the 
excursion 
at 
all) 
than 
we 
observe 
in 
the 
rest 
of 
the 


156 


uctuations 
around 
the 
equilibrium. 
Yet 
this 
autocorrelation 
comes 
from 
a 
chance 
trajectory 


157 


moving 
quickly 
away 
from 
the 
stable 
state, 
not 
from 
the 
critical 
slowing 
down 
pattern 
in 
the 


158 


return 
times 
to 
the 
stable 
state 
which 
precede 
a 
saddle-node 
bifurcation 
and 
motivate 
the 
early 


159 
warning 
signal. 


160 
This 
longer 
than 
expected 
excursion 
results 
in 
a 
higher 
than 
expected 
variance 
in 
that 
window 
8 



161 


as 
well. 
Both 
variance 
and 
autocorrelation 
are 
calculated 
using 
a 
moving 
window 
over 
the 
time


162 


series, 
which 
allows 
the 
method 
to 
pick 
out 
a 
pattern 
of 
change 
as 
the 
window 
moves 
along 
the 


163 


sequence. 
If 
this 
chance 
excursion 
that 
precedes 
the 
crash 
happens 
to 
ll 
a 
signicant 
part 
of 


164 


the 
moving 
window, 
the 
resulting 
pattern 
will 
tend 
to 
show 
an 
increase 
in 
autocorrelation 
or 


165 


variance. 
If 
the 
chance 
excursion 
is 
relatively 
rapid 
compared 
to 
the 
frequency 
at 
which 
the 


166 


system 
is 
observed 
(spacing 
of 
the 
data) 
or 
the 
width 
of 
the 
moving 
window, 
the 
excursion 
may 


167 


not 
signicantly 
alter 
the 
general 
pattern. 
In 
this 
way, 
some 
of 
the 
events 
in 
which 
a 
crash 
is 


168 


observed 
will 
appear 
to 
present 
these 
statistical 
patterns 
of 
increased 
variance 
or 
autocorrelation 


169 


without 
being 
harbingers 
of 
approaching 
critical 
transitions. 


170 


3.2. 
Comparing 
to 
the 
model-based 
method 


171 


In 
our 
numerical 
experiment, 
the 
model-based 
estimate 
of 
early 
warning 
signals 
appears 
more 


172 


robust 
than 
the 
summary 
statistics, 
producing 
the 
same 
estimates 
on 
both 
the 
conditionally 


173 


selected 
replicates 
as 
on 
a 
random 
sample 
of 
the 
replicates. 
This 
is 
a 
consequence 
of 
the 
more 


174 


rigid 
specications 
that 
come 
with 
a 
model-based 
approach 
– 
the 
pattern 
expected 
is 
less 
general 
175 
than 
any 
increase 
in 
variance 
or 
autocorrelation, 
but 
instead 
must 
be 
one 
that 
matches 
its 


176 


approximation 
of 
the 
saddle-node 
bifurcation. 
This 
observation 
highlights 
the 
dierence 
between 


177 


the 
pattern 
driving 
the 
false 
positive 
trends 
in 
increasing 
variance 
and 
increasing 
autocorrelation 


178 


and 
the 
pattern 
anticipated 
in 
the 
saddle-node 
model. 
This 
should 
not 
however 
be 
taken 
as 


179 


evidence 
that 
the 
model-based 
approach 
is 
immune 
to 
the 
bias 
of 
the 
Prosecutor's 
Fallacy. 


180 


The 
problem 
we 
highlight 
ultimately 
stems 
from 
the 
diculty 
of 
having 
only 
a 
single 
re


181 


alization 
with 
which 
to 
examine 
a 
complex 
problem. 
The 
only 
way 
to 
deal 
with 
this 
problem 


182 


embodied 
is 
through 
replication, 
as 
can 
be 
done 
in 
an 
experimental 
system 
in 
laboratory 
manip


183 


ulations 
such 
as 
Drake 
and 
Grien 
(2010); 
Veraart 
et 
al. 
(2011) 
and 
at 
the 
scale 
of 
whole 
lake 


184 


ecosystems 
in 
Carpenter 
(2011). 
Experimental 
procedures 
avoid 
the 
hazard 
of 
the 
Prosecutor's 


185 


fallacy 
by 
generating 
a 
complete 
sample 
of 
replicates, 
rather 
than 
selecting 
a 
subset 
of 
cases 


186 


from 
some 
larger 
historical 
sample.
