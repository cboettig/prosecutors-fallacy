We are pleased to submit our manuscript, "Early warning signals & the prosecutor's fallacy" 
for consideration for publication in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, B.  There is much 
recent research interest in the potential to identify early warning signs that a population, 
ecosystem, or environment is approaching a critical transition.  Historical data on systems 
that have experienced sudden shifts between to alternative stable states, such as the collapse
of a coral reef or end of a glacial period, have been used or proposed to evaluate these early 
warning indicators.  In this manuscript we demonstrate that such historical data sources must
be used with caution, as their selection can introduce a statistical bias to the results that 
dramatically increases the chance of false positives.  We also demonstrate how more explicit
model-based indicators are less vulnerable to this pattern.
